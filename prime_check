#Write a function that checks if a given number is a prime number.
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    #looks like initial solution would reduce the number of cycles by finding the square root of the number 
    #for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
    #I wrote this, less efficient, would try each one of the numbers
    for i in range(2, n-1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage:
print(is_prime(11))  # Output: True
print(is_prime(15))  # Output: False
print(is_prime(97))
